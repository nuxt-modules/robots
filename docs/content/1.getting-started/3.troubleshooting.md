## Debugging

### Nuxt DevTools

The best tool for debugging is the Nuxt DevTools integration with Nuxt Robots.

**How to Access:**

1. Install [Nuxt DevTools](https://devtools.nuxt.com/) if not already installed (it's enabled by default in Nuxt 3.7+)
2. Run your dev server with `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev`
3. Open your browser DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Opt+I on Mac)
4. Look for the Nuxt icon in the bottom-left corner of your browser window
5. Click the icon to open Nuxt DevTools
6. Navigate to the "Robots" tab in the left sidebar

**What You'll See:**

The DevTools panel will show you:
- Current robot rules applied to your site
- The generated `robots.txt` file content
- Active configuration from your `nuxt.config.ts`
- Route-specific rules and their sources

This makes it easy to verify that your robots configuration is working as expected without having to visit `/robots.txt` directly.

### Debug Config

You can enable the [debug](/docs/robots/api/config#debug) option which will give you more granular output in your server console.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  robots: {
    debug: true
  }
})
```

This is enabled by default in development mode and will log detailed information about:
- Which rules are being applied
- How the robots.txt file is being generated
- Any parsing or configuration issues

The debug output appears in your terminal/console where you're running the dev server, not in the browser console.

## Submitting an Issue

When submitting an issue, it's important to provide as much information as possible.

The easiest way to do this is to create a minimal reproduction using the Stackblitz playgrounds:

- [Basic](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-zycxux?file=public%2F_robots.txt)
- [I18n](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-pnej8lvb?file=public%2F_robots.txt)
