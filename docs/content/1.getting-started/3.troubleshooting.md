## Debugging

### Nuxt DevTools

The best tool for debugging is the Nuxt DevTools integration with Nuxt Robots.

This will show you the current robot rules and your robots.txt file.

### Debug Config

You can enable the [debug](/docs/robots/api/config#debug) option which will give you more granular output.

This is enabled by default in development mode.

## Submitting an Issue

When submitting an issue, it's important to provide as much information as possible.

The easiest way to do this is to create a minimal reproduction using the Stackblitz playgrounds:

- [I18n](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-pnej8lvb?file=public%2F_robots.txt)
